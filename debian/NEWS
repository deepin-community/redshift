redshift (1.9.1-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with version 1.9, redshift upstream has dropped support for
  determining location using GNOME Clock. Hence, users using the GTK
  variant of redshift need to provide the location information manually
  .
  The settings can be put into a file. Please refer to the manual page
  for details
